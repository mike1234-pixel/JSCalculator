## fcc frontend libraries project four

# JavaScript Calculator

This is a project made with React.js as part of the freeCodeCamp Frontend Libraries Certification.

The app parses string data then uses the `eval()` method to calculate a result, which is then converted to string data. As user input is restricted to the buttons and the script runs on the client with no backend [this is not vulnerable to cross-site scripting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/197769/when-is-javascripts-eval-not-evil).
